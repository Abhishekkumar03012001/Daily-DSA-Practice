# Daily-DSA-Practice
The Daily DSA Practice Repository is a comprehensive collection of coding exercises, problems, and solutions designed to help you improve your skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository serves as a valuable resource for programmers, software engineers, and computer science students who want to strengthen their understanding and proficiency in DSA.

The repository is structured to provide a daily dose of practice, ensuring a consistent learning experience. Each day, a new problem or exercise is added to the repository, covering a wide range of DSA topics. These topics include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, dynamic programming, and more.

Each problem or exercise is accompanied by a detailed problem statement, outlining the requirements and constraints. Additionally, you will find multiple test cases to validate your solution. The repository encourages you to actively engage in problem-solving, algorithm design, and implementation, promoting a hands-on approach to learning DSA.

The solutions to the problems are also provided within the repository. These solutions are implemented in popular programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. However, you are encouraged to solve the problems independently before referring to the solutions, as this helps solidify your understanding and problem-solving skills.

In addition to the daily problems, the repository also includes resources such as articles, tutorials, and explanations on fundamental DSA concepts. These resources serve as references for further understanding and provide insights into the underlying principles and techniques used in solving the problems.

The Daily DSA Practice Repository is an ideal tool for anyone looking to enhance their DSA skills, whether you are preparing for coding interviews, competitive programming contests, or simply seeking to improve your algorithmic thinking abilities. By practicing regularly, you will build a strong foundation in DSA, develop efficient problem-solving strategies, and gain the confidence to tackle complex programming challenges.

Join the Daily DSA Practice Repository today and embark on a journey of continuous improvement and mastery in Data Structures and Algorithms. Start sharpening your skills, and witness the transformative impact it will have on your programming abilities. Happy coding!

# Clone the Repository:

Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.
Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
Use the git clone command followed by the repository's URL to clone it to your local machine. 

For example:
git clone https://github.com/Abhishekkumar03012001/Daily-DSA-Practice.git
Create and Add the New File:

Navigate to the cloned repository's directory on your local machine.
Create a new file in the appropriate location within the repository's structure.
Add your code or content to the new file.
Stage the Changes:

In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the repository's directory if you're not already there.
Use the git add command followed by the name of the new file to stage the changes. 

For example:
git add new_file.py
Commit the Changes:

Use the git commit command to commit the staged changes. This command requires a commit message to describe the changes. 

For example:
git commit -m "Add new_file.py to the repository"
Push the Changes:

Finally, use the git push command to push the committed changes to the remote repository. This command requires authentication by providing your username and password or using SSH keys if set up. 

For example:
git push origin main
Here, "origin" is the name of the remote repository, and "main" is the branch to which you are pushing the changes. Adjust these values if your repository has a different remote name or branch name.
After following these steps, the new file should be successfully pushed to the Daily DSA Practice Repository. You can verify this by visiting the repository on the GitHub website or using the git log command in your local repository to see the commit history
